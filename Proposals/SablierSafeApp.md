## Project Overview

### Project name

Sablier Safe App

### Team members

- @PaulRBerg - building [Sablier](https://sablier.finance) and [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg-create-eth-app)
- @TomAFrench - just received his MSc at Imperial and looking for opportunities in Ethereum land

### What project are you building

A minimalistic port of the [Sablier Interface](https://pay.sablier.finance) into Safe. It will facilitate creating,
monitoring and cancelling streams, but not withdrawing from streams. You can read more about how Sablier-style money
streaming works in our [FAQ page](https://faq.sablier.finance).

Use cases:

1. "Continuous" payroll or freelancing
2. Subscriptions, paying for a product or a service in real-time
3. Investing, continuous ICOs; imagine a DAO using a Safe and streaming DAI to a founder and the founder streaming
   equity tokens or social money back

### Why did you decide to build it

We (the Sablier team) have been looking for a multisig solution that could interact with custom smart contracts for a
while. We ended up using the legacy [Gnosis Multisig](wallet.gnosis.pm), as it's the only one that provided us
with top-notch security
and extensibility (interacting with third-party contracts) at the same time.

Having a dedicated UI for calling Sablier from a multisig would be 10x better. We'd be our very first users.

### How long will it take

One week, or maybe a tad later than that.

### How much funding are you requesting

\$1,500 since it's a project of medium complexity.

### How did you hear about the GECO

Twitter + DM on Telegram.

### Others

Even if this proposal doesn't pass, I wanted to say thank you for doing this. I find it awesome that you guys grow your user
base by encouraging and rewarding FOSS developers for contributing to your product.
